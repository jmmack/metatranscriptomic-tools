Step 1) Pull genome files (see build_database_new.sh)

Step 2) Cluster ORFs to remove redundancy


This workflow came from:
/Volumes/rhamnosus/reference_genomes/may2013/cluster/uclust/

The .ffn reference sequences were concatenated into one file

Because of memory limitations, I couldn't use true centroid clustering. I sorted the sequences be deviation from median length and clustered from there

# Had to remove any seqs containing non-coding RNA because we were getting abundant 16S etc. mappings. Removed by BLAST:

# Do the clustering on sequences sorted by deviation from median seq length
# Try at 95% id and 90% id
